I am building a website for a school robotics program, the Shawnee Mission East High School. They participate in First Tech Challenge robotics, in the DECODE, presented by RTX 2025-2026 season. There are three teams, 21692, 26855, 20181. This website will be used to interactively display performance results of the three teams, team outreach, photos, and other information.

Your task is to build an incredible homepage for this robotics program. I want it to be really creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have an empty directory here, I want you to initalize a project with the follow specs:

- Vite
- Tailwind
- React
- Typescript
- Bun

One initalized, I want you to create SIX different designs, each featuring a technical, but not necessarily hacker-y style. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, and /6 respectively. Please keep the future in mind, and make it easy for you to add or remove test designs, and make it easy for you to convert one design into the final iteration in the future.

**Use your frontend design skill to make these designs *exceptional.***
